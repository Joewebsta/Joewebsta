ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Boston, MA. I enjoy learning new skills, designing robust systems and building products with strong UX + UI.

ðŸ›  I recently created Otto ([otto-etl.com](http://www.otto-etl.com/)), an open-source, web-based, and automated ETL (extract, transform, load) pipeline tool.
